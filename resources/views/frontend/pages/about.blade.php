            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">Frido is dedicated to enhancing daily living through innovative, ergonomic
                solutions that promote comfort and well-being.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-7">
                Frido’s story began with a simple yet powerful mission: to restore dignity and freedom to those who need it
                most. It all started with a groundbreaking idea—a wheelchair designed not just for mobility but for
                accessibility and independence. This became the Frido Go, the first-ever self-propelled shower and commode
                wheelchair capable of navigating complex spaces and folding neatly into a suitcase. From homes to hospitals,
                and even the Indian Army Veterans Rehabilitation Center, this innovation made waves across the world,
                reaching over eight countries.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7">
                But our journey didn’t stop there. As we listened to stories of people struggling with daily discomfort, a
                bigger vision took shape: to create solutions that bring comfort and freedom to everyone, every day. We
                ventured into designing products that address the smallest pain points and make a big difference—starting
                from the soles of your feet to the way you sleep at night.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7">
                Today, Frido is a trusted name for ergonomic, research-backed products that enhance daily living. Each
                product we create is fueled by the same passion that drove us to innovate from day one: to give people the
                freedom to do more.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7">
                Whether it’s an athlete like Mr. Saravana Kumar, who represented India in international para table tennis
                using a Frido wheelchair, or someone simply seeking relief from daily discomfort, our solutions are designed
                to empower lives.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-7">
                At Frido, we believe there’s always a better way to tackle life’s challenges. If you’re facing a problem,
                chances are we’ve already created a solution—or we’re working on one right now. We’re always listening,
                always learning, and always innovating.
