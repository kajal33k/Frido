                    Frido’s story began with a simple yet powerful mission: to restore dignity and freedom to those who need
                    it most. It all started with a groundbreaking idea—a wheelchair designed not just for mobility but for
                    accessibility and independence. This became the Frido Go, the first-ever self-propelled shower and
                    commode wheelchair capable of navigating complex spaces and folding neatly into a suitcase. From homes
                    to hospitals, and even the Indian Army Veterans Rehabilitation Center, this innovation made waves across
                    the world, reaching over eight countries.

                <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-6">
                    But our journey didn’t stop there. As we listened to stories of people struggling with daily discomfort,
                    a bigger vision took shape: to create solutions that bring comfort and freedom to everyone, every day.
                    We ventured into designing products that address the smallest pain points and make a big difference—
                    starting from the soles of your feet to the way you sleep at night.

                <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-6">
                    Today, Frido is a trusted name for ergonomic, research-backed products that enhance daily living. Each
                    product we create is fueled by the same passion that drove us to innovate from day one: to give people
                    the freedom to do more.

                    Whether it’s an athlete like Mr. Saravana Kumar, who represented India in international para table
                    tennis using a Frido wheelchair, or someone simply seeking relief from daily discomfort, our solutions
                    are designed to empower lives.
